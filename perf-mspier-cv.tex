  {Dec 2012 - Present}
  {Los Gatos, CA}
  {Optimize service reliability and performance, and help scale Netflix's high-traffic, large-scale distributed systems. Thorough performance analysis and tuning across all services and layers. Find optimizations both within application stacks and across the infrastructure. Develop effective observability tooling and and assist with production triage and root cause analysis on performance or availability issues.\\\\
  Created Vector, Netflix's open source on-host, high-resolution performance monitoring framework. Drove a company-wide program to improve service availability by implementing and applying a collection of best practices related to the development, deployment, and operation of cloud services. Developed Mogul, a bottleneck analysis tool that inspects internal and downstream dependency demand for services. Developed Slalom, a high-level demand analysis tool that helps visualize demand flow on large scale systems. Created a performance trend report to help identify long-term performance regression. Implemented and extended the capabilities of the in-house performance testing framework. Developed and supported the performance analysis tool with fully automated analysis capabilities. Drove performance test adoption company-wide and integration on continuous integration environments.\\}
